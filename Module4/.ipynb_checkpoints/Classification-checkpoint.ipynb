You can think of this response as having a Binomial distribution. For linear regression the response is just, well, linear. Logistic regression is a linear regression model with a nonlinear output. The response of the linear model is transformed or 'squashed' to values close to 0 or 1 using a **sigmoidal function**, also known as the **logistic function**. The result of this transformation is a response which is the log likelihood for each of the two classes. \n",

Some care is require in determining which case is being reported.\n",
