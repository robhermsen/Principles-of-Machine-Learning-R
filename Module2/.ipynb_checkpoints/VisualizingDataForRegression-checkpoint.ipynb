    "\n",
    "Before creating analytical models, a data scientist must develop an understanding of the properties and relationships in a dataset. There are two goals for data exploration and visualization. First to understand the relationships between the data columns. Second to identify features that may be useful for predicting labels in machine learning projects. Additionally, redundant, collinear features can be identified. Thus, visualization for data exploration is an essential data science skill.\n",
    "In this lab you will explore two datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this lab, your first goal is to explore a dataset that includes information about automobile pricing. In other labs you will use what you learn through visualization to create a solution that predicts the price of an automobile based on its characteristics. This type of predictive modeling, in which you attempt to predict a real numeric value, is known as **regression**; and it will be discussed in more detail later in the course. For now, the focus of this lab is on visually exploring the data to determine which features may be useful in predicting automobile prices."

Keep in mind that not all plot aesthetics are equally effective. Tests of human perceptions have shown that people are very good as noticing small differences in position. This fact explains why scatter plots are so effective. In rough order of effectiveness these aesthetics are:\n",
    "1. **Marker shape** is an effective indicator variable category. It is critical to select shapes which are easily distinguished by the viewer. \n",
